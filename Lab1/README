Limitations:
Not sure exactly how to treat exit status of the pipe command. According to the regular shell the pipe command's exit status is still good if the second commandworks, but the first does not. We are not sure whether or not pipe exit status should be good or not depending on the pipe's commands. For now we left the pipe exit status as good regardless of the two commands.
