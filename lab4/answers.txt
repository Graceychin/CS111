# EXERCISE 1: What method you used to make your peer download and upload
#    files in parallel?  (~1-3 sentences)
	Used processes and forking. Use a seperate process for each file that is downloaded
or being upload. This part is really brief and short. 

# EXERCISE 2A: What conditions did you find and fix that would have
#    triggered a buffer overrun bug?  (~1-3 sentences each)
	Whenever there is a strcpy there may be bufferoverflow if the source is too big. I added
in a limit to the number of bytes transferred over using strncpy. This was applicable for
a few task->filename copies. 

# EXERCISE 2B: What other robustness problems did you fix?  (~1-3 sentences
#    each)

# EXERCISE 3: Describe the attacks you implemented for "evil mode".  Why
#    are they attacks?  (~3-10 sentences each)

# Extra credit problems
#Extra credit problem: none

# Add any other information you'd like us to know below this line.
